Mariam’s loved by most of her peers, has the ability to bond with anyone and loves working in a team. 
As a child she’s always loved doing plays and has a profound passion for acting and theatre. She has been a part of a number of plays and hence has rightfully earned the title of being a dramaqueen.

Having been interested in football, she was a part of her school football team for a very long time &amp; has a keen interest in the sport.
mariam is a very convincing &amp; confident person and public speaking is her forte. Trust us when we say that this girl can talk herself out of any situation! 
Having done both her trinity and lamda exams, she has fair bit of experience and aspires to become an eminent lawyer one day.
All these qualities combined with her child like innocence makes her the perfect person to portray Debbie, one of the female characters in this production and our very own billy’s love interest.</p>
